Files necessary to make UTRec work with the practice mod.

Download the latest version [here](https://example.com)

You need to setup ffmpeg on your device.

Extract the zip. Place the exec/ folder in your practice mod folder (with the data.win and UNDERTALE.exe files) and drop execute_shell_simple_ext.dll directly in the practice mod folder too.
That's it

Notes.
* Using this "extension" may affect performance. You are pretty much guaranteed to get a lag spike when you end a recording or take a clip.
* Recorded videos are not legal for leaderboard submissions.
* Audio might be weird in recordings. For example a music that's already playing when recording starts won't be present in the video.
