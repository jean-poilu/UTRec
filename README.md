Files necessary to make UTRec work with the practice mod.
It is Windows exclusive.

Download the latest version [here](https://example.com)

You need to setup ffmpeg on your device. To do this, the simplest way is to download the latest build [here](https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/ffmpeg-release-essentials.zip), then add it to your system paths.
To do this, search "environment variables" in your Windows search bar and click on the result. At the bottom of the window, click on "Environment Variables...". Then, in the user variables table, click on "Path" and then "Edit". Click on "New" and add the path to your ffmpeg bin folder (e.g. "C:\Program Files\ffmpeg\bin\").

Extract the zip. Place the exec/ folder in your practice mod folder (with the data.win and UNDERTALE.exe files) and drop execute_shell_simple_ext.dll directly in the practice mod folder too.
That's it

Notes.
* Using this "extension" may affect performance. You are pretty much guaranteed to get a lag spike when you end a recording or take a clip.
* Recorded videos are not legal for leaderboard submissions.
* Audio might be weird in recordings. For example a music that's already playing when recording starts won't be present in the video.
